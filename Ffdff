Here’s the data from your image, organized into a clear table format:

Package / Component	Version	CVE ID	Vulnerability Type / Description
@Angular/Core	17.3.10	CVE-2024-21490	Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
Moment	2.29.3	CVE-2022-31129	Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Axios	1.7.7	CVE-2023-27552	Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Axios	1.7.7	CVE-2023-38754	Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Express	4.19.2	CVE-2024-43796	Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
@Angular/Core	17.3.10	CVE-2022-25869	Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
Would you like me to also include severity ratings (e.g., CVSS scores) for these CVEs? I can fetch them from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).

Here’s an updated table including the CVSS (or available severity scores) for each vulnerability from your list:

Package / Component	Version	CVE ID	Vulnerability Type / Description	CVSS Base Score
@Angular/Core	17.3.10	CVE-2024-21490	Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (catastrophic back-tracking DoS)	7.5 (High) — vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Notes & caveats:

For the two CVEs (CVE-2023-27552 and CVE-2023-38754) associated with Axios, I was unable to find publicly cited CVSS base score information in the sources I checked.

Some CVSS scores come from vendor bulletins or third-party sources rather than directly from the NVD and thus may differ slightly or later be updated.

CVSS is just one dimension of risk (e.g., exploitability, environment, exposure also matter).

If you like, I can check further for the missing CVSS scores (for the Axios CVEs) and also fetch temporal or environmental scores where available.
